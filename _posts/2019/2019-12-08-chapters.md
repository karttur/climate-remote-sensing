## Introduciton


## Chapters

### Historical records

#### Land

African Humid Period.
[Subsurface Valleys and Geoarcheology of the Eastern Sahara Revealed by Shuttle Radar](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-218-4576-shuttle-radar-sahel-buried-channels/)

China-tanten at my Stockholm Univeristy Department has recently published on ITCZ and Norht African Monosoon (2019).

#### Ocean

[The oceanic sink for anthropogenic CO2 from 1994 to 2007](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-363-6432-rocean-co2-sink-1994-2007/)


### Present situations

#### Overall

[The seasonal fingerprint of climate change](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-361-6399-climate-change-seasonal-fingerprint/)

#### Land

#### Ocean

##### Ocean temperature - the big [temperature] blob

##### Vanishing arctic sea ice

The warming anomaly in Arctic waters.

##### Ocean winds - the CO2 transfer

[Science article on increases wind speed using a range of sensors. Global Trends in Wind Speed and Wave Height.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6028/451)

Transfer of CO2 in the Arctic ocean and how the arctic ocean disappearing ice change that.

##### Explaining Ocean Circulation

El Nino and Climate indexes, have they become redundant.

[OCO instrument show carbon content correaltions woth El Nino](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-358-6360-rs-oco-2-el-nino/)

[The great Atlantic Sargassum belt](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-365-6448-sargassum-remoite-sensing/)


#### Cryosphere

[ICESAT-2 NASA space laser targets melting poles](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-361-6407-NASA-iceat-2/)

### Future possibilities

#### general

##### Remote sensing for avoiding double counting

[Double counting and the Paris Agreement rulebook](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-365-6460-SROCC-summary/)

[Somewhere I saw a list on opportunities for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide content?](https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/09/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky)

- forest
- soil
- (wetlands?? so I can add something)
- ocean
- rock weathering
- direct capture

#### Land

[Global reforestation potential (Restoring forests as a means to many ends)(https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-365-6448-forest-restoration-benefits/)

#### Ocean

[Mangrove storm protectionservice](https://karttur.github.io/readingfruits/science/science-365-6448-mangrove-storm-protection-remote-sensing/)

### Discussion

Climate agreements (the Paris deal) and democracy (Science article from 2018): [Democracy and climate-change action](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6443/846.18).
